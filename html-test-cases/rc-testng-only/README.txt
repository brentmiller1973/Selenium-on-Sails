Test cases that can only run and pass successfully against the remote control/selenium1 driver.

Most of these test cases will be anything that requires javascript functionality as the selenium2 webdriver does
not handle javascript like RC.

Before saving a test case in here. You should save the test case in your hot-deploy folder and run the test case against 
the webdriver to see if it passes.
